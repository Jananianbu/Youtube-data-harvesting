# YouTube Data Harvesting and Visualization
This project focuses on harvesting data from YouTube using Python. It utilizes YouTube API to fetch data and stores it in MongoDB. Additionally, it creates MySQL tables for specific data subsets. The data is then visualized through a Streamlit web application for an interactive interface.

Overview:
Data Harvesting: Python scripts fetch data from YouTube using the YouTube API.
Database Storage: Data is primarily stored in MongoDB for flexibility and scalability. MySQL tables are created for specific data subsets requiring structured storage.
Visualization: Streamlit is used to create a web application for visualizing the harvested data.
Features:
YouTube API Integration: Seamless integration with YouTube API for data retrieval.
Flexible Storage: Utilizes MongoDB for flexible document storage and MySQL for structured data storage.
Interactive Interface: Streamlit app offers an intuitive interface for data visualization.
Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of YouTube data efficiently.
Customization: Easily customizable to suit specific data harvesting and visualization need
